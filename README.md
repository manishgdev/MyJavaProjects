# MyJavaProjects
This project is created to store my personal projects and I use this project to store my learning on any topic in Java

One very good quote from a Seb Rose's presentation 
***"Software Development is hard, Understanding what our methods and tools are good for can make it easier"***

In Eclipse it takes a lot of time to refractor a method having name as **getName()** a bug in eclipse as described in https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=351410
